TO DO list:

* Modify the Renderer so the SDL_Texture instances are managed by the RenderersManager to avoid duplications.

* Add a TextureManager for the SpriteRenderer-related textures

* Add a TextRenderer: Renderer and a FontManager to provide the Fonts (Texture-containing classes)

* Review all engine classes and implement (or delete) copy constructors/assignments and move constructors/assignments
