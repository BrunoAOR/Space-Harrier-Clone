# Space Harrier Clone
__Space Harrier Clone__ is (you guessed it) a clone of the old-school Space Harrier Game.
Find the project webpage at [https://brunoaor.github.io/Space-Harrier-Clone/](https://brunoaor.github.io/Space-Harrier-Clone/) or the full project code at [https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Space-Harrier-Clone](https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Space-Harrier-Clone).


## What is this?
Space Harrier Clone is a tribute to the old-school Space Harrier arcade game published in 1985 by SEGA. This tribute was built using the SDL library and taking as a base a small SDL-based 2D game engine called the Potato Engine ([https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Potato-Engine](https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Potato-Engine)), which I had been working on before.

## How to use?

### Installation
No installation is required. All you need to do is download the zipped game from the latest release found at [https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Space-Harrier-Clone/releases](https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Space-Harrier-Clone/releases), unzip the folder and run the _Space Harrier Clone.exe_ file found within.

### Basic game controls
The following list shows the usable keyboard keys:
* __Arrow keys__: Used to move the player around the screen and to change letters in the scoreboard if your score is high enough.
* __Left Control__: Used to fire and to accept a selected letter in the scoreboard screen.
* __Space__: Used as the "start button".
* __Q__: Used to "insert a coin" and get 3 lives (Remember, this is ia tribute to an arcade game).

### Game objectives
The game is very straight forward. All you need to do is fly throught the level firing at everything that comes your way. Once you reach the end of the level, you will face a powerful snake-dragon. Upon defeating the dragon, you will have won the game.
Bear in mind that the original game had 18 different levels but this tribute only includes the first level.

### Building the game
To build the game you just need to clone the repo, open it in the IDE of your preference and compile it. If you intend to play the game from your IDE, make sure to modify the execution folder (called Working Directory in Visual Studio) under the debug settings of the Space Harrier Clone project and make it point to the __Game__ folder inside the project directory.
