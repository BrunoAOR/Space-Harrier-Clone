				<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
				<p>Space Harrier Clone is a tribute to the old-school Space Harrier arcade game published in 1985 by SEGA. This tribute was built using the SDL library and taking as a base a small SDL-based 2D game engine called the Potato Engine (<a href="https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Potato-Engine">https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Potato-Engine</a>), which I had been working on before.</p>

				<h2 id="how-to-use">How to use?</h2>

				<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
				<p>No installation is required. All you need to do is download the zipped game from the latest release found at <a href="https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Space-Harrier-Clone/releases">https://github.com/BrunoAOR/Space-Harrier-Clone/releases</a>, unzip the folder and run the <em>Space Harrier Clone.exe</em> file found within.</p>

				<h3 id="basic-game-controls">Basic game controls</h3>
				<p>The following list shows the usable keyboard keys:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Arrow keys</strong>: Used to move the player around the screen and to change letters in the scoreboard if your score is high enough.</li>
					<li><strong>Left Control</strong>: Used to fire and to accept a selected letter in the scoreboard screen.</li>
					<li><strong>Space</strong>: Used as the “start button”.</li>
					<li><strong>Q</strong>: Used to “insert a coin” and get 3 lives (Remember, this is ia tribute to an arcade game).</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="game-objectives">Game objectives</h3>
				<p>The game is very straight forward. All you need to do is fly throught the level firing at everything that comes your way. Once you reach the end of the level, you will face a powerful snake-dragon. Upon defeating the dragon, you will have won the game. Bear in mind that the original game had 18 different levels but this tribute only includes the first level.</p>

				<h3 id="building-the-game">Building the game</h3>
				<p>To build the game you just need to clone the repo, open it in the IDE of your preference and compile it. If you intend to play the game from your IDE, make sure to modify the execution folder (called Working Directory in Visual Studio) under the debug settings of the Space Harrier Clone project and make it point to the <strong>Game</strong> folder inside the project directory.</p>
